## Gospel of the triune God

Jesus Christ is the one true God (2nd Person of the Trinity) in the flesh, who came to save sinners (e.g., liars).  
He died on the cross and was resurrected, taking upon Himself God's wrath for those who would turn from their sin and trust in Him.  
Christ is the perfect Savior that saves by grace through faith alone.
